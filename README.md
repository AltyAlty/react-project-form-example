<h1 align="center">Sign-up Form Example</h1>

This is an example of a sign-up form built on `React` using the `react-hook-form` library. The form is my attempt to use the best practices for such forms.

<br>

The sign-up form contains:
* Right types for the fields in order to provide better experience for users, because modern browsers provide additional tools (such as autocompletion, field validation or password generating) depending on field types.
* Field highlighting to give users right understanding where they are in the form and whether they have made any mistakes or not.
* Fields validation, error processing and showing error messages to help users make less mistakes and faster complete the form.
* Using special attributes to allow screen readers to read the fields, which is, for example, essential to people who are blind, and is useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability.
* A number of other things that generally improve user interaction with the form.
