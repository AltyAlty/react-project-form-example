<h1 align="center">Sign-up Form Example</h1>

This is an example of a sign-up form built on `React` using the `react-hook-form` library. The form is my attempt to use the best practices for such forms.

The sign-up form contains:
* **_Setting appropriate types for the fields_** in order to provide better experience for users, because modern browsers offer additional tools (such as autocompletion, field validation or password generating) depending on field types.
* **_Highlighting fields_** to give users right understanding where they are in the form and whether they have made any mistakes or not.
* **_Field validation_**, **_error processing_** and **_displaying error messages_** to help users make less mistakes and faster complete the form.
* **_Using special attributes_** to allow screen readers to read the fields, which is essential, for example, to people who are blind, visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability.
* (_still in progress_) A number of other things, such as **_responsive design_**, **_readable fonts_**, etc., that generally improve user interaction with the form.
